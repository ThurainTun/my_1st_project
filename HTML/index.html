      <p>
        Skateboarding is a sporting activity in which an individual rides on a
        short, narrow board, usually made of some composite material, to which
        are attached a pair of small wheels at each end of the board. The rider
        propels himself or herself by placing one foot on the board and pushing
        on the ground with the other foot. The rider typically stands in an
        upright or crouching position on the board, from which position any
        number of tricks can be performed.

    <h2 class="heading">Purpose</h2>
    <div class="para">
      <p>
        People ride skateboards for a variety of reasons, including pure
        recreation, as a means of transportation, as a type of artistic display,
        or as a career as a professional skateboarder.

        showed that participation in skateboarding has declined significantly in
        recent years, falling from a total of 10.13 million more-than-once
        participants in 2006, to a low of 5.83 million participants in 2011, and
        somewhat rebounding to 6.44 million more-than-once participants in 2015;
        a decline of 3.68 million from its high to its low over the time period
        from 2006 to 2015. The largest one-year decline, from 2010 to 2011,
        occurred primarily among so-called “frequent” riders, those who
        participated in the sport more than 52 times a year.

        From 2006 and 2014, the number of skateboarders from the age of 6 to 17
        years decreased from 8.75 million to less than 4 million. However,
        during this same period, the number of participants aged between 18 and
        24 years increased slightly. Surveys tend to show that the vast majority
        of skateboarders are male. Data suggest that the sport is becoming
        somewhat less popular among the mid-adolescent range (early teens),
        although it has begun to grow in popularity among the youngest age
        group, those between the ages of five and nine.

        Most skateboarders date the beginnings of their sport to the end of the
        1940s and early 1950s when a number of surfers began exploring ways of
        pursuing their sport in settings other than the ocean. They conceived
        the idea of putting wheels on strips of wood similar to surfboards and
        “surfing” city streets on these boards. The activity was given the name
        of “sidewalk surfing.” For a decade, enthusiasm for the sport surged,
        and sales of wheeled surfboards surpassed the US$10 million mark by
        1965. A year earlier, a specialty publication, Skateboarder Magazine,
        began publication, and also in 1965, the first international
        skateboarding championship was in Anaheim, California. The contestants
        were primarily 12- to 14-year-old boys, and the winner was 15-year-old
        Danny Bearer, later to become a skateboarding icon. By the early 1970s,
        skateboarding had begun to lose its appeal; sales of boards declined and
        Skateboarder Magazine went out of business.
